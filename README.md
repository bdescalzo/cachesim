# cachesim
Basic cache memory simulator for a Computer Architecture class

## ABOUT
This project is a basic cache memory simulator, programmed for a Computer Architecture class. It supports the following features:
- Choosing the word size, the block size, and the the placement and replacement policies.
- Choosing a directory in the simulated memory, and applying a read or write operation.

The simulator will interpret the direction, return either a hit or miss, inform of whether replacement has occurred, and report an access time (based on a formula).
